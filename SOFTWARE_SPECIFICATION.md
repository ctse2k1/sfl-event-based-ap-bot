# Software Specification: SFL Event-Based Activity Point Bot

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document outlines the software specifications for the SFL Event-Based Activity Point Bot. The bot is designed to automate the tracking of user participation in timed Discord events and reward them with activity points. This system aims to increase community engagement by providing a transparent, code-based event participation system with automated point calculation and comprehensive tracking.

### 1.2. Scope
The bot operates within Discord server environments using slash commands. Its primary functions include creating events with unique join codes, managing participant registration, tracking participation duration, calculating points, and providing comprehensive data access to users and administrators.

### 1.3. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **Discord:** A VoIP and instant messaging social platform
- **Bot:** An automated program that runs on Discord
- **Guild:** A Discord server
- **Event:** A time-bound activity with a unique join code, managed by the bot
- **Event Host:** A user who creates and manages an event
- **Event Code:** A unique 4-character alphanumeric identifier for joining events
- **Activity Points (AP):** Points awarded to users based on participation duration
- **JSON:** JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data-interchange format
- **Instance Management:** System for preventing multiple bot instances from running simultaneously

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. High-Level Architecture
The system is a single Python application that connects to the Discord Gateway API via the `discord.py` library. It maintains state in-memory with persistent storage to organized JSON files in a dedicated data directory.

**Core Components:**
- **Core Logic:** `bot.py` contains the main application logic, including command handling, event management, point calculation, and instance management
- **Configuration:** `config.json` stores event type definitions in an array structure
- **Data Storage Directory:** `data/` directory containing:
  - `active_events.json`: Current running events and participant data
  - `event_records.json`: Historical participation records
  - `event_records_backup_*.json`: Timestamped backups created during resets
- **Environment Variables:** `.env` file stores sensitive configuration (Discord token)

### 2.2. Dependencies
- **`discord.py`**: Primary library for Discord API interaction
- **`python-dotenv`**: Environment variable management
- **`psutil`**: Process management for instance control
- **Standard Python Libraries:** `json`, `os`, `datetime`, `asyncio`, `logging`, `random`, `string`, `time`, `sys`, `signal`, `shutil`, `atexit`
